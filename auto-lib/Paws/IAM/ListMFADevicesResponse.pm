Paws::IAM::ListMFADevicesResponse

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IsTruncated => Bool

A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your
results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request
using the C<Marker> request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that
IAM might return fewer than the C<MaxItems> number of results even when
there are more results available. We recommend that you check
C<IsTruncated> after every call to ensure that you receive all of your
results.


=head2 Marker => Str

When C<IsTruncated> is C<true>, this element is present and contains
the value to use for the C<Marker> parameter in a subsequent pagination
request.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MFADevices => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IAM::MFADevice>]

A list of MFA devices.


=head2 _request_id => Str
